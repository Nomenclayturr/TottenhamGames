## Notes
For some reason, the GIF is not showing up in the README file. I'm not sure why. I've tried to use the Imgur link but it's not working. I added the gif to the project folder instead, under Kapture.gif.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had a lot of trouble with the styling of the cards and the responsiveness of the site. I had to spend a lot of time researching and watching tutorials to get the cards to look the way I wanted them to.
